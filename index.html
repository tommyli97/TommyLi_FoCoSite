		<h3>What's Tea Time?&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>
				<p>
					Tea Time is a tea company that produce and distribute quality tea leaves to more than 50 countries. All our tea exceed specialty-grade standards as well as being certified organic.
				</p>
				<p>
					While we breed and produce quality tea leaves, we are also making sure that our farms and distribution methods are highly sustainable and environmental friendly. All our tea can be traced back to its source, often sourced from a select group of producers we have worked with on average 5 years or more.
				</p>
				<p>
			    Now we are bringing our tea right to your neighborhoods in the form of leaves and read-to-to drinks. Introducing our first storefront tea shop that allows you to sit down and enjoy your tea with some snack. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
